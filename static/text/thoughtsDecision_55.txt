The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which is where we want to be to reach the designated area as per the instructions.

Since you are already in the rightmost lane, the priority is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed in relation to the car ahead to ensure safety.

The car, vehicle `992`, ahead of the ego-vehicle in the same lane is only `27.08 m` away and travelling at `20.02 m/s`, which is significantly slower than the ego-vehicle's speed of `28.00 m/s`. This suggests a potential risk for collision if speed is not adjusted.

The action utility analysis indicates that accelerating or maintaining the same speed (Idle) would be unsafe due to the risk of collision with the slower vehicle in front.

Deceleration is marked as safe and recommended to maintain a safe following distance and avoid potential collision with vehicle `992`.

Therefore, given that we're already in the appropriate lane, the best action is to decelerate to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
