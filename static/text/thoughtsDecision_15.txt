Looking at the distance to the vehicle ahead in the current lane: The distance to vehicle `368` is `22.09 m`, whereas it is moving faster than the ego-vehicle with a speed of `16.59 m/s` compared to the ego-vehicle's speed of `10.63 m/s`. This means the gap will increase over time, but currently, the distance is insufficient to maintain a safe TTC larger than 4.

Checking if right lane change is viable: The vehicle in the right lane (`600`) is only `3.94 m` behind with a higher speed of `19.01 m/s`. Right lane change is unsafe due to this close proximity and speed differential, which could potentially cause a collision.

Since a right lane change is not safe and there's no lane to the left, the focus should be on ensuring safety within the current lane.

According to the action utility analysis, accelerating or idling has been deemed unsafe due to potential collisions with vehicle `368`. Deceleration is recommended to create a safe following distance.

Final action: `#### 4`
