Since you are driving in the rightmost lane and there is no possibility to change lanes further to the right, you should remain in your current lane as per the guideline to not change lanes when already in the rightmost lane. However, you must also prioritize maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front. 

1. Checking the distance and speed difference with the front vehicle (Vehicle `992`), it is currently `18.50 m` ahead and traveling slower than you, which means you are getting closer over time. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) is likely under 4 seconds, indicating potential unsafe conditions. Therefore, you need to take action to maintain a safe distance.

2. The action utility analysis specifies that Decelerating is safe and recommended due to the proximity of the front vehicle, while Accelerating and Idling are marked unsafe.

Based on the above reasoning, Decelerating is the most appropriate action to enhance safety. 

Final action: `#### 4`
