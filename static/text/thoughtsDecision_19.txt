Currently, the ego-vehicle is driving in the leftmost lane with a speed of `10.63 m/s`. The car ahead (368) is `36.88 m` away, traveling faster at `17.13 m/s`, ensuring an acceptable time-to-collision (TTC).

Given the distance from Vehicle `368` and the higher speed of the car ahead, maintaining an appropriate distance and speed difference does not currently require acceleration or deceleration.

As per the information, a right lane change is safe and recommended. This aligns with our goal, as the target area is on the rightmost lane. Evaluation of the right lane shows that the vehicle `600` ahead is `15.42 m` away, traveling faster at `19.27 m/s`, and the vehicle `648` behind is `40.37 m` away, traveling at `18.17 m/s`. This means a right lane change is safe with enough space both in terms of speed and distance from other vehicles.

Since a right lane change is considered safe and recommended, and it moves the ego-vehicle closer to the target rightmost lane, this is the prudent action step.

Final action: `#### 2`
