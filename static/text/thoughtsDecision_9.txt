The closest vehicle ahead of the ego is vehicle `368`, which is only `15.06 m` away and traveling slower than the ego vehicle. This requires immediate corrective action to maintain a safe distance and avoid collision.

The ego vehicle should not accelerate or maintain its current speed, as these actions might result in a collision given that the vehicle in front is both slower and closer than a safe distance.

Changing lanes to the right is assessed as unsafe, as there are vehicles on the adjacent right lane with insufficient gaps to safely execute the lane change.

Deceleration is recommended to increase the distance from the vehicle ahead and maintain a safe time-to-collision (TTC) greater than 4, as per the utility analysis. 

Final action: `#### 4`
