Given the current driving scenario:

1. The distance to the vehicle directly ahead of the ego-vehicle (`784`) is `16.33 m`, with its speed at `17.36 m/s` compared to the ego-vehicle's speed of `12.95 m/s`. The TTC is not a concern if speed management occurs.

2. The goal is to move towards the rightmost lane. However, analyzing the surroundings shows that a right lane change is currently unsafe due to potential collisions, particularly with vehicle `992` which is very close at a distance of `6.23 m`.

3. Currently, the ego-vehicle is in the third lane from the left, meaning it must eventually shift towards the rightmost lane. But first, it has to navigate current lane constraints safely.

4. Considering action utility analysis:
   - Change to left lane: Safe but doesn't align with the objective.
   - Change to right lane: Unsafe.
   - Idle: Unsafe.
   - Accelerate: Unsafe, suggesting possible collision risks.
   - Decelerate: Safe and recommended, suggests maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and resolving the current height-speed discrepancy.

5. Opting for deceleration allows for potentially better lane management soon, while maintaining safe driving conditions for the ego-vehicle.

Final action: `#### 4`
