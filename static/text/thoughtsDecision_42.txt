Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, we need to maintain a safe distance and speed relative to the car ahead.

1. The ego-vehicle follows behind Vehicle `992`, which is `35.67 m` ahead and has a speed of `19.00 m/s`. The ego-vehicle speed is `12.95 m/s`. There is a considerable distance ahead given the ego-vehicle's speed is lower than Vehicle `992`.

2. The time-to-collision (TTC) with the vehicle in front can be calculated simply since there is no risk of immediate collision because we are moving slower than the target vehicle (TTC is essentially infinite since we are not catching up).

3. The next priority is to manage speed to ensure an appropriate distance with the vehicle in front and to ensure flow motion because you are in the target lane already.

4. The current speed (`12.95 m/s`) is substantially lower than both the vehicle ahead (`19.00 m/s`) and the recommended highway speeds, so increasing speed (Accelerate) to match closer to the surrounding vehicles' speed is advisable.

Final action: `#### 3`
