Firstly, check the distance and speed difference with the car in front:
- Vehicle `600` is `53.87 m` ahead at a speed of `19.46 m/s`.
- Ego-vehicle's speed is `12.95 m/s`.
- With a speed difference of `6.51 m/s`, the Time-To-Collision (TTC) is approximately 53.87/6.51 = 8.27 seconds. This is above the threshold of 4 seconds, so the distance is appropriate but closer monitoring is needed as per the utility recommendation.

Secondly, assess the possibility of changing to the right lane:
- Currently, the right lane change is noted as unsafe with a potential collision risk, which is unacceptable. Hence, a right lane change is not an option at this time.

Assess if staying in the current lane and lane change options:
- Since a right lane change is not feasible, evaluate current lane options.
- Staying in your current lane is safe, and the action utility analysis recommends deceleration to ensure continued safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

Considering these factors, the best action is to decelerate to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and remain prepared for a right lane change when it becomes safe.

Final action: `#### 4`
