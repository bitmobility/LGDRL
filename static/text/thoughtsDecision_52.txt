Since you are already in the rightmost lane, you should stay in this lane according to the requirement.

The target ahead is `125.0 m` away in the same lane and is not an immediate concern.

The vehicle directly ahead, Vehicle `992`, is `37.24 m` ahead at `19.89 m/s`. Your current speed is `24.53 m/s`, which is faster, leading to a negative speed difference.

The TTC (Time to Collision) can be calculated using the formula: TTC = Distance / Relative Speed. Your relative speed to Vehicle `992` is \(24.53 - 19.89 = 4.64\) m/s. The TTC is \(37.24 / 4.64 \approx 8.02\) seconds, which is greater than 4 seconds and is safe.

In terms of action utility analysis, accelerating is recommended since you need to accelerate to catch up with the greater gap ahead.

However, to ensure a balance between speed adjustments and safety, we need to also consider maintaining a safe distance. Since accelerating is recommended and the current speed is slightly greater, accelerating will help in reaching an optimal distance without exceeding safety requirements.

Final action: `#### 3`
