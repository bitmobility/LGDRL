The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane, and there is no possibility of changing to the left lane since there is no lane on the left. 

The front vehicle in the ego-vehicle's lane is `29.82 m` ahead, with a speed of `16.88 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `8.32 m/s`, so it's not maintaining an appropriate speed difference or distance (TTC needs to be calculated and is possibly below the threshold of 4 seconds).

Considering the vehicles in the adjacent right lane, vehicle `600` is only `6.14 m` ahead with a higher speed of `19.16 m/s`, making the right lane change unsafe at the current moment.

Based on action utility analysis, accelerating or idling is unsafe because the ego-vehicle is too close to the front vehicle and may lead to a collision. Changing to the right lane is considered unsafe due to a high risk of collision.

Decelerating is noted to be safe and recommended to maintain an appropriate distance from the front vehicle.

Final action: `#### 4`
