First, I assess the situation to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the vehicle ahead in my current lane (Vehicle `368`). The vehicle ahead is at a distance of `14.64 m` with a speed of `15.80 m/s`, and my speed is `15.26 m/s`. Given the small distance and the slight acceleration of vehicle `368`, I am too close to safely maintain a time-to-collision (TTC) greater than 4. 

Next, I consider whether a right lane change is possible. Despite there being some space in the right lane, the action utility analysis indicates that a right lane change is deemed unsafe due to a potential collision risk. Therefore, changing lanes is not currently an option.

Since I am not in the rightmost lane, my current goal is to ensure safety by creating more distance with the vehicle directly ahead. Given that acceleration is labeled as unacceptable in the utility analysis due to potential collision risks, and being too close makes idling unsafe, the only safe maneuver is to decelerate.

Deceleration is both safe and recommended according to the action utility analysis, as it allows me to reduce the speed and increase the distance to the vehicle ahead, thus preventing potential collision and improving TTC.

Final action: `#### 4`
