Given the current situation, let's analyze each step thoroughly:

1. **Maintain appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front:**
   - Current situation: Vehicle `368` is `21.16 m` ahead with a lower speed of `14.28 m/s`. Ego vehicle speed is higher at `21.05 m/s`. 
   - Time-to-collision (TTC) needs to be larger than 4. Due to the small distance and higher relative speed, the TTC is less than desired.
   - Action: Deceleration is necessary to reduce speed and increase distance from vehicle `368`.

2. **Consider a right lane change if it is safe:**
   - Current status: Unsafe to change to the right lane due to possible collision with vehicle `552` ahead and `600` behind in the right lane.
   - Action: Remain in the current lane until it is safe to change lanes.

3. **Already in the rightmost lane:**
   - Not applicable as the ego vehicle is in the leftmost lane.

4. **Action utility analysis:**
   - Change to right lane: Unsafe due to potential collision risks.
   - Idle and Accelerate: Both considered unsafe given proximity to vehicle `368`.
   - Decelerate: Only safe and recommended action to increase distance from vehicle `368`.

Final action: `#### 4`
