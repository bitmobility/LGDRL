Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, we focus on appropriate speed and distance management with the vehicle `992` ahead.

The speed of the ego-vehicle is `25.68 m/s`, and the speed of vehicle `992` ahead is `19.94 m/s`. Therefore, the ego-vehicle is faster than the vehicle in front by `5.74 m/s`.

The distance to vehicle `992` is `34.41 m`. We need to ensure that the Time-to-Collision (TTC) stays larger than 4 seconds.

TTC = Distance / Speed difference = 34.41 / 5.74 â‰ˆ 5.99 seconds. 
The current TTC is greater than 4 seconds, which is safe. However, if the gap is already considered safe and since acceleration is recommended to catch up, let's consider further:

It is recommended by the action utility analysis to accelerate to catch up with the vehicle ahead because the gap is rather large considering highway speeds.

Taking into account that it is safe to accelerate and there is no immediate safety concern:

Final action: `#### 3`
