The ego-vehicle is currently in the second lane from the left and needs to move to the rightmost lane. 

Analyzing the distance and speed of the vehicles in the current lane,
- Vehicle `600` is `50.67 m` ahead, with a speed of `19.45 m/s`. 
  - The TTC is relatively safe, confirming the gap allows sufficient reaction time.
- The distance to Vehicle `648` behind the ego-vehicle on the current lane is sufficient and your speed is higher, indicating more space will be gained naturally.

Now, analyze the situation on the right lane where the ego-vehicle seeks to move:
- Vehicle `784` is `7.58 m` ahead and moving at `16.84 m/s`, making immediate lane change unsafe due to short spacing.
- Vehicle `208` is `41.24 m` behind which is a safe spacing, but there's insufficient space ahead with Vehicle `784`.

Considering the action utility analysis:
- Right lane change is deemed unsafe because of the close proximity of the vehicle ahead in the right lane (Vehicle `784`).
 
The recommended action to improve the right lane change possibility without compromising safety:
- **Accelerate**: This option allows the ego-vehicle to speed up and gain positionally, better managing space with Vehicle `600` ahead while preparing for a safer right lane switch opportunity in future.

Final action: `#### 3`
