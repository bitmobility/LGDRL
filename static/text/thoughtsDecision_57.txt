The goal is to maintain a safe driving environment while aiming to keep the vehicle in the rightmost lane. Since our ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, there's no need for a right lane change.

Next, observe the vehicle ahead in the current lane (Vehicle `992`) which is `20.76 m` away. The speed of Vehicle `992` is `20.09 m/s`, whereas the ego-vehicleâ€™s speed is `25.68 m/s`. The time-to-collision (TTC) is calculated as the distance divided by the relative speed (`20.76 m` / (`25.68 m/s` - `20.09 m/s`)) = approximately 3.51 seconds, which is less than the minimum safe TTC of 4 seconds.

Considering the action utility analysis: Accelerating is unsafe due to the proximity of the vehicle ahead, and IDLE is also deemed unsafe. Changing to the left lane appears safe, but our priority is to remain in the rightmost lane according to the principles.

Deceleration is recommended and safe, as it increases the distance to the vehicle ahead and improves the time-to-collision. 

Given the circumstances, the best action is to Decelerate for maintaining safety in our current lane.

Final action: `#### 4`
