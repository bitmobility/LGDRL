First, I need to evaluate the distance and relative speed to the vehicle in front of me on the current lane. The vehicle is `38.85 m` away, traveling at a speed of `17.76 m/s`, while my speed is `10.63 m/s`. This means the Time to Collision (TTC) is approximately \( \frac{38.85}{17.76 - 10.63} \approx 5.53 \), which is greater than 4, although the distance is on the tighter side.

Next, I check the possibility of changing to the right lane. The action utility analysis suggests that changing to the right lane is safe and recommended, and I am currently not in the rightmost lane, but the third lane from the left. There is a vehicle `15`.59 meters ahead in the right lane (992) traveling at a faster speed (`18.12 m/s`), which may pose a challenge at a gap creation. However, changing lanes might provide an opportunity to increase distance to the vehicle currently ahead in my lane subsequently.

I also need to ensure the lane change will not cause conflict with the vehicle behind in the right lane (88) which is `34.62 m` behind and traveling slightly faster than my current speed.

The utility analysis confirms that changing to the right lane is recommended to ensure smoother alignment towards the target lane. Maintaining speed (IDLE) will maintain the current conditions which won't significantly improve the situation for merging to the right lane. Since the speed difference is not substantial and the gaps are manageable, changing lanes to the right now presents an optimal opportunity to proceed towards the rightmost lane.

Final action: `#### 2`
