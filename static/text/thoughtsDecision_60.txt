The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which is the designated area. Hence, there is no need to change lanes to the right.

The vehicle `992` is `15.74 m` ahead in the same lane. Its speed is `20.17 m/s`, which is slower than the ego-vehicle's speed of `22.21 m/s`. This means the distance will close rapidly, potentially creating a dangerous situation.

The action utility analysis indicates that both the Idle and Accelerate actions are unsafe, as they might cause the ego-vehicle to collide with the car ahead.

Deceleration is both safe and recommended, aiming to increase the distance between the ego-vehicle and the vehicle ahead (vehicle `992`), ensuring a safe time-to-collision (TTC) is maintained.

There is no lane available on the right, so the ego-vehicle must remain in the current lane.

Final action: `#### 4`
