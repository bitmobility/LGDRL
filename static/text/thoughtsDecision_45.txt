Vehicle `992` is ahead of the ego-vehicle in the same lane, with a distance of `41.73 m`. The speed of Vehicle `992` is `19.36 m/s`, compared to the ego-vehicle's speed of `16.42 m/s`. The Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated as:  
TTC = Distance / (Speed of target - Speed of ego) = 41.73 / (19.36 - 16.42) â‰ˆ 13.65 seconds.  
The TTC is greater than 4, so the distance and speed difference with the car ahead is appropriate.  

Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, there is no need to change lanes. 

The action utility analysis suggests that accelerating might be a good strategy due to being a little far from the front vehicle and having the opportunity to close the gap safely. 

Final action: `#### 3`
