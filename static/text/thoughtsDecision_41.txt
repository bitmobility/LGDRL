Since you are already in the rightmost lane, the priority is to maintain a safe distance and appropriate speed relative to the vehicles around you.

1. Currently, your speed is `11.79 m/s`, and the vehicle ahead of you in the rightmost lane (Vehicle `992`) is `32.62 m` away, traveling faster at `18.85 m/s`. 

2. Your Time to Collision (TTC) with the vehicle ahead, `992`, can be analyzed as:
   - Relative Speed = `18.85 m/s` - `11.79 m/s` = `7.06 m/s`
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Speed = `32.62 m` / `7.06 m/s` â‰ˆ 4.62 seconds, which is safe as it is greater than the threshold of 4 seconds.
   
3. Vehicle behind you in your lane (`88`) is at `21.28 m` distance and traveling faster than your current speed so it can catch up.

4. According to the action utility analysis, accelerating is safe and recommended. Since the vehicle ahead is at a safe distance and you are not at your target speed, you can accelerate to maintain a more efficient speed. An acceleration will reduce the relative speed difference and optimize the gap between you and vehicle `992`.

5. There is no option to change lanes to the right, and changing to the left is unnecessary here because you are already in the correct lane.

Final action: `#### 3`
