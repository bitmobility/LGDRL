Vehicle `600` is ahead of me in my lane at a distance of `56.60 m`. It's moving faster than me with a speed of `19.46 m/s`. Since its acceleration is minimal, the TTC (Time to Collision) is large enough to not require immediate braking since I am moving slower (`14.11 m/s`).

Vehicle `784` is ahead of me in the right lane, but it's very close, only `11.05 m` away. This makes lane changing to the right unsafe.

Considering that right lane change is deemed unsafe and there is no sufficient space to safely execute the maneuver, I must remain in the second lane for now.

With my current lane position following the car ahead (`600`) at a safe distance, I need to focus on maintaining a safe speed. Recommendation from action utility analysis suggests deceleration to avoid getting too close to front vehicle, which aligns with maintaining safety.

Final action: `#### 4`
