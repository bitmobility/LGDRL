The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane. 

According to step 1, the first priority is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car ahead. Vehicle `992` is ahead in the same lane at a distance of `23.63 m`, and its speed is significantly lower (`20.06 m/s`) compared to the current ego vehicle's speed (`26.84 m/s`). The time-to-collision (TTC) would be shorter than the required 4 seconds.

According to step 3, the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane. Therefore, maintaining the current lane position and adjusting speed becomes crucial for safety.

The action utility analysis indicates that deceleration is safe and recommended to prevent getting too close to the vehicle ahead. Therefore, any form of acceleration or lane change is deemed unsafe or not relevant in this scenario.

Final action: `#### 4`
