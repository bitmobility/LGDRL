Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, the first priority of changing to the right lane does not apply.

Now, assess speed and distance with the vehicle in front (`992`). The vehicle is `40.23 m` ahead and driving faster at `19.25 m/s`, while the ego-vehicle is at `15.26 m/s`. This results in a decreasing relative distance, thus maintaining a speed difference compared to the lead car is necessary.

Analyzing action utilities, accelerating is recommended due to being further from the front vehicle and shows safe conditions.

Given this evidence, taking an acceleration action can help maintain an appropriate speed and distance, based on the action utility analysis indicating it is both "safe and recommended."

Final action: `#### 3`
