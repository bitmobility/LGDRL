First, evaluate the distance and speed difference to the vehicle in front of you. You are traveling at `8.32 m/s`, and the vehicle in front is at `19.37 m/s`, with a distance of `31.32 m`. The speed difference suggests you will not close the gap quickly. Currently, the Time To Collision (TTC) is acceptable given your relative speed; however, your speed is quite lower than the car ahead, which means you are too far behind.

Since you are currently not in the rightmost lane, consider changing to the right lane. However, the available analysis indicates that a right lane change is unsafe due to a possible collision, especially with Vehicle `784`, which is quite close behind in the right lane.

Considering that you can't change to the right lane immediately, check if speeding up is advisable. The action utility analysis recommends accelerating because you're far from the vehicle ahead. This will help you prepare for a future right lane change by reducing the distance with the car in front if the opportunity arises.

Based on the analysis, the best course of action right now is to accelerate.

Final action: `#### 3`
