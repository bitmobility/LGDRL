Firstly, I need to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front of me. The vehicle `368` is `14.50 m` ahead of me with a speed of `15.55 m/s`, which means I am too close to the vehicle ahead. Considering both the vehicle's and my speeds and the available information, I must ensure the time-to-collision (TTC) remains larger than 4 seconds to avoid any potential collision.

Secondly, I must consider changing lanes to the right if safely possible. Since I'm currently in the leftmost lane, this is crucial. However, according to the action utility analysis, attempting to change to the right lane is deemed unsafe due to the potential for a collision, making this option unacceptable at the moment.

Additionally, since accelerating is marked as unsafe, this leaves Decelerate as the sole viable and recommended option. Deceleration helps maintain an appropriate distance from the vehicle ahead and ensures safety by addressing the current proximity concern.

Final action: `#### 4`
