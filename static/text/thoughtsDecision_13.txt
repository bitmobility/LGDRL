Firstly, assess the distance and speed difference with the vehicle `368` ahead in the same lane. The distance is `17.01 m` with the ego-vehicle speed of `12.95 m/s` and vehicle `368` speed of `16.23 m/s`. The TTC needs to be larger than 4 for safety. Calculating the TTC:

\[
\text{TTC} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed difference}} = \frac{17.01}{16.23 - 12.95} = \frac{17.01}{3.28} \approx 5.18
\]

The TTC is slightly larger than 4, indicating some level of safety, but due to the small distance, maintaining safety concerns we should consider deceleration.

Secondly, consider the right lane change. Vehicle `552` is ahead by `55.13 m` but is moving faster than the ego-vehicle, and vehicle `600` is quite close behind at `11.51 m` while traveling significantly faster than the ego-vehicle. This makes a lane change risky.

Based on the action utility analysis, deceleration is recommended as it is considered safe and provides adequate spacing. This will also help in creating some space to the right for future lane changes.

Final action: `#### 4`
