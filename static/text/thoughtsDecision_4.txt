Currently, the ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane with a vehicle ahead at a close distance of `28.92 m`. The front vehicle is decelerating, and it poses a risk of collision if the current speed is maintained or increased.

Due to the close proximity to the vehicle in front, it is essential to maintain a safe distance and avoid accelerating, as this increases the chance of collision. The appropriate action is to decelerate to increase the following distance and ensure safety.

Moreover, the analysis confirms that change to the right lane is currently unsafe due to inadequate space, particularly considering the proximity of Vehicle `600` behind in the adjacent lane, making it unsafe for a right lane change.

Given these factors and recommendations from the action utility analysis, the optimal decision is to decelerate to ensure safety and maintain an appropriate distance from the vehicle ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
