The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which aligns with the requirement to be in the designated area.

The vehicle ahead in the same lane is at a distance of `15.24 m` with a speed of `20.19 m/s`, while the ego-vehicle's speed is `21.05 m/s`. This indicates that the time to collision (TTC) is getting close to the danger zone, and maintaining the current speed is unsafe. Accelerating is also unsafe as it may cause a collision.

The action utility analysis recommends deceleration as safe and necessary to increase the distance between the ego-vehicle and the vehicle in front, and thereby maintain a safe TTC.

Considering all the information, the most appropriate and safe action is to decelerate.

Final action: `#### 4`

****Decision generated by LLM expert: Decelerate****
