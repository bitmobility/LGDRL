Given the scenario where the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, rule 3 applies, which states that the ego-vehicle should remain in this lane.

Considering the safe and unsafe actions:

- The vehicle in front (vehicle `992`) is quite close, only `16.82 m` ahead, with a speed of `20.15 m/s`, which means the time to collision (TTC) is too short if the ego-vehicle continues at its current speed of `23.37 m/s`.
  
- The action utility analysis indicates that Idle is unsafe, and accelerating is unsafe as well, as it may cause a collision, which is unacceptable.

- Decelerating is shown as the only safe and recommended option as it allows the ego-vehicle to maintain a safer following distance with the vehicle in front by reducing speed, thereby increasing the TTC.

Thus, based on rule 1 and the action utility analysis, the most suitable decision is to decelerate for safety until a proper following distance is maintained.

Final action: `#### 4`
