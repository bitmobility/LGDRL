First, assess the distance and speed difference with the vehicle ahead in the current lane. The distance to Vehicle `600` is `47.94 m`, with a speed of `19.44 m/s` compared to the ego vehicle's speed of `12.95 m/s`. This indicates that the vehicle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe time-to-collision (TTC) of more than 4 seconds.

Next, evaluate the possibility of changing to the right lane. The vehicle (Vehicle `784`) ahead in the right lane is only `6.20 m` away, moving at `16.67 m/s`. This close proximity makes lane changing unsafe, risking a collision, as noted in the action utility analysis.

Since a change to the right lane is unsafe and we are not yet in the rightmost lane, evaluate actions that can create enough lane space or improve driving conditions. The action utility analysis suggests that accelerating is both safe and recommended to close the distance with the vehicle ahead and potentially allow a safer right lane change later.

Stay in the current lane and accelerate to adjust position; the acceleration action is deemed safe and can help create future opportunities for changing lanes to reach the target.

Final action: `#### 3`
