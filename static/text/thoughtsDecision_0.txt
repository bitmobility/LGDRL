Currently, the ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane without any vehicle directly ahead in the same lane.

The goal is to move to the rightmost lane where the target is located, which is possible only through lane changes to the right.

There are vehicles in the right adjacent lane: Vehicle `552` is ahead at a distance of `38.13 m` moving faster, and vehicle `600` is slightly behind at a distance of `1.12 m` moving slower. This makes a right lane change unsafe currently.

The action utility analysis indicates that accelerating is recommended due to the lack of a vehicle in the direct path, allowing the ego-vehicle to catch up and potentially create safer conditions for a future lane change.

Final action: `#### 3`
