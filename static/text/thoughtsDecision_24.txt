The ego vehicle is currently in the second lane from the left with a speed of `10.63 m/s`. The vehicle ahead in the same lane is `40.77 m` ahead and is moving at a speed of `19.41 m/s` with a positive acceleration. The TTC with this vehicle is very high, given our significant speed difference.

Since you are not in the rightmost lane, the next step is to consider a right lane change. However, the right lane change is currently unsafe because there is a vehicle (vehicle `784`) only `1.99 m` ahead of us in the right lane traveling faster than us.

Since right lane change is unsafe, we assess the current speed and TTC with the car in front. The target vehicle is quite a bit further ahead, which allows us room to accelerate safely to reduce the distance to the vehicle ahead. Accelerating here is indicated by the utility analysis as both safe and recommended to align our speed better with the overall traffic flow.

Final action: `#### 3`
