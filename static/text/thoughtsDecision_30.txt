The first step is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car directly ahead in the same lane. The vehicle ahead, `600`, is `59.80 m` away with a speed of `19.47 m/s`. My current speed is `12.95 m/s`, which creates a speed difference of `6.52 m/s`. The distance of `59.80 m` is sufficient to maintain a safe gap, considering our speed difference. 

Next, I need to consider whether I can safely and effectively change to the right lane. Vehicle `784` in the right lane is `13.11 m` ahead, moving at `17.26 m/s`. Given my lower speed, moving directly into the right lane could create an unsafe proximity to vehicle `784`. Additionally, vehicle `208` is behind at `37.38 m` with a slightly higher speed of `16.27 m/s`. 

To safely execute the right lane change, I must ensure enough space is available in both lanes. The analysis indicates that changing to the right lane is safe and recommended, but given the proximity of `784`, the proper course of action would be to adjust my speed downward to create a larger gap.

Considering the option to decelerate facilitates a future safe lane change and helps align with the current action utility analysis that suggests changing to the right lane is safe and recommended, albeit after better gap management.

Final action: `#### 4`
