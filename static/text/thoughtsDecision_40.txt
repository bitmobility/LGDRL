Given the current situation:

1. I am in the rightmost lane where I should ideally remain according to the guidelines provided unless safety dictates otherwise.

2. The vehicle ahead (`992`) is only `29.03 m` away traveling at a faster speed (`18.69 m/s`) compared to my current speed of `10.63 m/s`, which makes the Time-to-Collision (TTC) calculation essential. Given my current speed and the relative speed difference, I should maintain a safe distance to avoid collision.

3. The action utility analysis indicates that Deceleration is the safe and recommended action due to the proximity to the vehicle in front. This aligns with my task of keeping a safe distance and not being too close to the car ahead.

4. I'm currently in the rightmost lane, so the goal is to stay in this lane. There's no lane to the right to maneuver into.

5. Since I'm in the correct lane and the critical consideration is maintaining safe distance, decelerating is the only safe choice according to the analysis that aligns with the guidelines.

Final action: `#### 4`
