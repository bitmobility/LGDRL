The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, meaning no right lane change is possible because no lane exists to the right.

Given the current lane position and traffic conditions, the ego-vehicle is `31.03 m` behind the vehicle in front, vehicle `992`, which has a lower speed of `19.98 m/s` compared to the ego-vehicle's speed of `26.84 m/s`. This indicates that the time to collision (TTC) is approximately 4.4 seconds, as the relative speed difference could rapidly decrease this distance. This is close to the safe threshold of 4 seconds. Hence, a right lane change cannot be performed, and we should prioritize adjusting speed and maintaining safety.

The action utility suggests that accelerating is safe and recommended because the vehicle might be seen as too far compared to the target which is 99 meters ahead, indicating that there is potential space to close in on with vehicle `992`.

Since we cannot change lanes and are already on the rightmost lane, the focus is on adjusting velocity. Deceleration is something that may be necessary to ensure the TTC is maintained or increased due to the presence of a vehicle in front. Given the close distance and speed difference, deceleration is currently a safe and viable option.

Thus, the most suitable choice given safety concerns and the utility analysis is to decelerate to increase safety margins without any additional lane change.

Final action: `#### 4`
