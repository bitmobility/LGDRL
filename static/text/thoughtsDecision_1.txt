Considering the given situation:

1. **Distance and Speed Difference:**  
   - The vehicle ahead in my lane (`Vehicle `368``) is `39.55 m` away, traveling at a slower speed of `17.27 m/s` with deceleration. I am currently traveling at `21.05 m/s`, which means I am closing in on this vehicle, and the distance is decreasing quickly. Maintaining TTC larger than 4 is crucial.

2. **Right Lane Change Check:**  
   - The right lane has `Vehicle `552`` ahead, which is traveling faster and slightly ahead at `38.79 m`, and `Vehicle `600`` with a significantly shorter gap of `2.07 m` behind me, traveling slower. The right lane change is unsafe due to insufficient space between my car and vehicle `600` behind.

3. **Current Lane Evaluation:**  
   - Staying in the current lane is feasible. Vehicle `368` ahead has a lower speed and negative acceleration, indicating it is slowing down further, increasing the risk of reducing the TTC if I stay idle or accelerate. 

4. **Action Utility Analysis:**  
   - Given that changing to the right lane is unsafe and continuing at the current speed holds the risk of closing in on the car ahead too quickly, accelerating isn't advisable.
   - Decelerate is safe and will increase the distance from `Vehicle `368``, providing a safer following distance. 

Final action: `#### 4`
