First, let's assess the distance and speed difference with the car in front on the current lane:

- The car ahead, Vehicle `784`, is `31.08 m` away, traveling at `17.66 m/s` while the ego-vehicle is at `8.32 m/s`. 
- The time to collision (TTC) can be calculated using the formula: distance / relative speed = 31.08 / (17.66 - 8.32) = 3.51 seconds. 
- TTC is less than 4 seconds, so maintaining this distance is unsafe for current speed. Deceleration is recommended to increase the TTC.

Next, consider the possibility of a right lane change in order to reach the target in the rightmost lane:

- The action utility states that a right lane change is unsafe due to the proximity of Vehicles `992` and `88`, which could result in a collision.

Given that a right lane change is currently unsafe and staying in the current lane requires addressing the TTC issue with vehicle `784`, we should decelerate to safely manage the following distance while maintaining our lane. 

Final action: `#### 4`
