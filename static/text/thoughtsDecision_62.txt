The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane with no option to change lanes to the right. This means the vehicle should remain in its current lane.

The vehicle `992` ahead is only `15.34 m` away, traveling at slightly higher speed of `20.21 m/s`. This distance is close, and maintaining or increasing speed (Idle/Accelerate) might lead to a collision, making these actions unsafe.

Given the vehicle's current speed of `19.89 m/s` and the vehicle ahead's speed (`20.21 m/s`), the time-to-collision (TTC) indicates potential for collision if an immediate action isn't taken, given the proximity.

The safest option, as suggested by the utility analysis, is to decelerate to increase the distance to the vehicle ahead and maintain a safe TTC.

Final action: `#### 4`
