Vehicle `784` is ahead of the ego-vehicle at a distance of `35.25 m` with a speed of `17.71 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `9.47 m/s`, which is slower than the vehicle in front, reducing the chance of closing the gap too quickly. However, considering the recommended safety action advises deceleration, it's important to ensure a safer distance.

The space required for a safe right lane change is currently unavailable as `vehicle `992`` in the right lane is too close to the ego-vehicle at a distance of `11.85 m`, with a higher speed than the ego-vehicle. Hence, the action utility analysis indicates the right lane change as unsafe.

Given that a lane change to the right isn't permissible, the ego-vehicle must consider maintaining a safe gap with `vehicle `784`` in its lane. Decelerating is advised to ensure a safe distance and avoid colliding with the vehicle ahead. The action of deceleration is both safe and necessary according to the utility analysis.

Final action: `#### 4`
