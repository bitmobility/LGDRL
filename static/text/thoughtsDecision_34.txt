Based on the given information, let's evaluate the situation systematically.

1. Firstly, assess the appropriate distance and speed:
   - Currently, the ego-vehicle speed is `9.47 m/s`, and the vehicle ahead (`784`) is at `17.60 m/s`. The gap is `26.48 m`. The TTC is calculated as distance/speed difference = 26.48/(17.60 - 9.47) = 3.05 seconds, which is below the safe threshold of 4 seconds. Therefore, maintaining current speed or accelerating is Unsafe.
   
2. Second, evaluate the possibility and safety of lane changes:
   - For a right lane change, the vehicle (`992`) is just `3.11 m` ahead in the right lane, and given its speed (`17.39 m/s`), it is moving much faster than the ego-vehicle. Hence, changing lanes to the right is Unsafe.

3. Consider left lane change:
   - Although changing to the left lane is declared Safe, it contradicts the final goal of moving to the rightmost lane and is currently unnecessary because we are focused on moving to the right.

4. Evaluate actions based on utility:
   - Deceleration is identified as Safe and recommended to manage the too-close distance to vehicle `784`.

5. The action with current high utility aligning with safety and final goal is Decelerate:
   - Decelerating will help increase the TTC concerning the vehicle ahead (`784`), mitigating the risk of a collision.

Based on the rationale and considerations detailed above:

Final action: `#### 4`
