Firstly, assess the distance and speed difference with the car (Vehicle `368`) in front of the ego-vehicle. The distance is `15.48 m`, and Vehicle `368` is moving at `16.03 m/s` with my current speed being `14.11 m/s`. The TTC (Time-to-Collision) is approximately `15.48 / (16.03 - 14.11)` which is `7.9 seconds`, which is larger than 4 seconds, but relatively close.

The ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane, and the goal is to safely change lanes toward the rightmost lane. However, a right lane change is deemed unsafe due to proximity concerns with Vehicle `600`, which is behind on the right. This aligns with the action utility analysis stating that changing to the right is currently unsafe.

Since maintaining speed by Idling is not recommended due to the proximity and current conditions outlined, and accelerating is unsafe, the only safe and recommended option is to decelerate to increase the distance to the car in front and prepare for a possible right lane change when it becomes safe.

Final action: `#### 4`
