The first priority is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front.

The vehicle `600` ahead in our lane is `25.85 m` ahead moving at `19.34 m/s`, while we are traveling at `9.47 m/s`. The current distance is small relative to the speed difference; hence it's needed to adjust the speed to prevent any risk of collision.

The available action utilities suggest deceleration as safe and recommended while accelerating or idling is considered unsafe.

The second condition checks if a right lane change is possible. The surrounding vehicle information indicates that a lane change to the right is unsafe due to the proximity and speed of vehicles in the next lane. Therefore, it cannot be executed properly without significant risk.

We decide on a safe action to maintain distance and support potential opportunities for lane change later if needed.

Final action: `#### 4`
