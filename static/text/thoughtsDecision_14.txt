Given the information and requirements, I will make a decision following the specified guidelines:

1. **Distance and Speed Difference with Car in Front**: Vehicle `368` is `19.22 m` ahead of the ego-vehicle with a speed of `16.42 m/s`, while the ego-vehicle speed is `11.79 m/s`. This satisfies the requirement as there is enough distance not to be too close, but we need to consider whether this distance includes an appropriate Time-to-Collision (TTC).

2. **Right Lane Change Consideration**: Since the option of right lane change is marked 'unsafe', due to vehicle `600` being just `8.04 m` behind in the right lane, attempting to change lanes is not recommended. We need to stay in the current lane and create space either through deceleration or maintaining an appropriate idle speed.

3. **Current Lane Safety and Maintenance**: The priority is to maintain a safe operation in accordance with traffic flow and avoid short following headways. The action utility indicates deceleration as safe and recommends it to avoid potential collision risks.

Considering both the action utility and specified guidelines, the right decision aligns with safety protocol:

Final action: `#### 4`
