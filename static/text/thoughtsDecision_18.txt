The first step is to evaluate the speed difference and distance with the car directly ahead `368` in my lane. My current speed is `9.47 m/s`, while the vehicle ahead is going at `17.01 m/s`. The distance to this vehicle is `33.61 m`, indicating there is sufficient space not requiring deceleration. However, due to my speed being significantly lower than the car ahead, accelerating would help in maintaining an appropriate distance and speed difference.

Secondly, I need to consider a right lane change, but according to the action utility analysis, changing to the right lane is currently unsafe because it may involve a collision, especially with vehicle `600` only `11.05 m` ahead. This suggests there is not enough space for a safe lane change.

Since I am not already in the rightmost lane, the next steps involve creating adequate space for a potential right lane change in the future. By accelerating, I can reduce the large speed difference between myself and vehicle `368`, which might later enable a safer right lane change by overtaking `600` once it is clear.

Finally, evaluating the available actions, accelerating not only ensures a safe distance and appropriate speed but also aligns with the recommendation from the utility analysis which suggests catching up to the vehicle ahead due to being too far.

Final action: `#### 3`
