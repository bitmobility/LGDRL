Since you are already in the rightmost lane, there's no need to change lanes. Therefore, your focus should be on maintaining appropriate distance and speed. 

The vehicle ahead (`992`) is `42.41 m` away and its speed is slightly lower than your current speed. To maintain a safe time-to-collision (TTC) greater than 4 seconds, it's crucial to adjust the speed. 

The action utility analysis suggests it is safe and recommended to accelerate since you are too far from the front vehicle. 

Final action: `#### 3`
