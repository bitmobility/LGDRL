Considering the current scenario:

1. **Maintain an appropriate distance and speed from the car in front**: 
   - You are currently too close to Vehicle `368` ahead, with a distance of `24.72 m` and a different speed `13.87 m/s`. This means you need to decelerate to maintain a safe distance.

2. **Right lane change if safely possible**: 
   - Currently, a right lane change is unsafe due to Vehicle `552` ahead in the adjacent lane and Vehicle `600` behind. The action utility analysis also confirms that a right lane change is not recommended.

3. **Action Utility Analysis**: 
   - Deceleration is noted as the safe and recommended action to maintain a safe distance and avoid collision with Vehicle `368`.

Given these points, the decision is to prioritize safety by decelerating to create a safer distance from the vehicle ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
