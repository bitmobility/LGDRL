Based on the initial analysis:
1. Verify distance and speed difference with the car ahead in the lane: Vehicle `600` is ahead of us at a distance of `44.64 m`, with a speed of `19.43 m/s`. Our current speed is `11.79 m/s`, which is significantly less than the speed of Vehicle `600`. Their small acceleration doesn’t change the situation much. We are too slow compared to it and have a safe TTC (over 4s). We should accelerate to close the gap and match its pace.

2. Evaluate right lane change feasibility: We are currently one lane away from the rightmost lane. However, changing to the right lane currently is marked as unsafe due to the presence of Vehicle `784` ahead, just `4.34 m` away.

3. Consider current lane action: Since we are too slow behind Vehicle `600` and there’s a need to move towards the right lane, adjusting our velocity is required. Acceleration is safe and recommended to close the gap, enhancing our ability to maneuver and find a suitable moment to change lanes rightward in future scenarios.

Final action: `#### 3`
