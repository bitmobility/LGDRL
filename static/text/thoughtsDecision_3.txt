The car in front on the current lane is vehicle `368`, which is `33.19 m` ahead, traveling at a speed of `15.27 m/s`, and decelerating at -`2.00 m/s`Â². Since the ego vehicle is moving faster at `23.37 m/s`, the time to collision (TTC) is not greater than 4 seconds, posing a risk of getting too close.

Given the current speed difference, I should not maintain the current speed or accelerate as both actions would decrease the gap, potentially leading to a collision.

Next, I should consider the option of a right lane change since we are not in the rightmost lane. However, the utility analysis indicates that changing to the right lane is currently unsafe and not acceptable due to vehicle `552` which is just `38.12 m` ahead at a speed of 21.82m/s and vehicle `600` is `7.20 m` behind, creating a high risk of collision when attempting the lane change. Therefore, changing to the right lane is not an option.

Since maintaining current speed or accelerating is unsafe and changing lanes to the right is also deemed unsafe at the moment, I am left with the option to decelerate. The utility analysis confirms that deceleration is safe and recommended to maintain a safe distance from vehicle `368` ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
