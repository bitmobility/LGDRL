Firstly, evaluate the distance and speed difference with the car in front of the ego-vehicle on the current lane. The distance is `42.95 m` to Vehicle `784`, which is safe for maintaining traffic flow. However, the Time to Collision (TTC) should be checked: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance to Vehicle `784`}}{\text{Speed of Vehicle `784`} - \text{Ego speed}} = \frac{42.95}{17.80 - 9.47} = 5.13 \) seconds, which is larger than 4 seconds. This condition is safe.

Check if a lane change to the right is possible and recommended by action utility analysis. The change is considered safe and recommended for the pathway to the rightmost lane. On the right lane, vehicle `992` is ahead (`19.90 m`) but traveling faster, at `18.33 m/s`; thus, a lane change is feasible and safe.

Given that a right lane change is possible safely, this should be prioritized since the long-term goal is to reach the designated area on the rightmost lane.

Therefore, the most suitable action is to change lanes to the right immediately since it is safe and aligns with the guidance objectives.

Final action: `#### 2`
