The vehicle directly in front of our ego-vehicle is vehicle `368`, which is only `16.35 m` away and traveling slower than the ego-vehicle at `14.98 m/s`. With the current speed of the ego-vehicle at `18.74 m/s`, maintaining the current speed might lead to a collision. To maintain appropriate distance and safety with the car in front, the ego-vehicle should decelerate. 

Considering the adjacent lane on the right, performing a right lane change is deemed unsafe since it may result in a collision, particularly because of vehicle `552` ahead and vehicle `600` behind, indicating the space is insufficient for a safe right lane change.

Decelerating is marked as safe and recommended in the action utility analysis; thus, it is crucial to ensure there is no imminent risk of collision and gives the ego-vehicle time to reassess the opportunity for right lane change later.

Final action: `#### 4`
