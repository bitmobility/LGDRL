Since you are already in the rightmost lane, you should stay in this lane.

Analyze the distance and speed to the car ahead:
- Vehicle `992` is `42.70 m` ahead of you with a speed of `19.46 m/s`.
- Ego-vehicle speed is `17.58 m/s`.

Considering the Time-To-Collision (TTC):
- The relative speed (speed difference) to the vehicle ahead (`992`) is 19.46 - 17.58 = `1.88 m/s`.
- TTC = Distance to the car ahead / Relative speed = `42.70 m` / `1.88 m/s` â‰ˆ 22.71 s, which is safe because it is larger than 4 seconds.

Currently, there is more distance to the front vehicle than the minimum safety, indicating room to adjust speed:
- Ego-vehicle has a speed of `17.58 m/s`, which is slower than the vehicle in front by `1.88 m/s`.
- A recommendation from the action utility analysis suggests you should accelerate to catch up, as you are too far from the front vehicle.

Final action: `#### 3`
