To determine the best action for guiding the ego-vehicle safely toward the target in the rightmost lane, let's consider the steps:

1. **Maintain Appropriate Distance and Speed:**
   - Vehicle `784` ahead in the same lane is `46.60 m` away, traveling at `17.83 m/s`.
   - The ego-vehicle's current speed is `10.63 m/s`.
   - The Time to Collision (TTC) with vehicle `784` is approximately 6.98 seconds (TTC = distance / relative speed, where relative speed is 17.83 - 10.63 = `7.20 m/s`). This TTC is greater than 4 seconds.

2. **Right Lane Change:**
   - The distance to vehicle `992` ahead in the right lane is `23.85 m`, and vehicle `88` is `27.86 m` behind with speeds indicating the change to the right lane is safely possible.
   - According to the action utility analysis, the right lane change is safe and recommended.

3. **Current Lane Analysis:**
   - If the ego-vehicle were already in the rightmost lane, it should stay. However, the ego-vehicle is currently in the third lane from the left.

Given these considerations, the immediate action to safely facilitate reaching the target is the right lane change. 

Final action: `#### 2`
