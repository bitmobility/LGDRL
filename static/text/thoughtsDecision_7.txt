The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane, with the goal of eventually moving towards the rightmost lane.

First, I will check the distance to the car in front (Vehicle `368`) in the same lane and the speed difference:
- The distance to Vehicle `368` is `18.38 m`, and its speed is `14.64 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `19.89 m/s`. The speed difference is `19.89 - 14.64 = 5.25 m/s`.
- Time to Collision (TTC) with Vehicle `368` is `18.38 / 5.25 â‰ˆ 3.5 seconds`, which is less than the acceptable threshold of 4 seconds, indicating the current distance and speed difference is unsafe.

Next, I will consider the possibility of a right lane change:
- The right lane change is currently marked as unsafe due to potential collision risks with Vehicle `552` ahead and Vehicle `600` behind. 
- Vehicle `552` is `38.06 m` ahead with a speed of `21.62 m/s`, and Vehicle `600` is `18.03 m` behind with a speed of `17.22 m/s`.

The available actions are:
- Idle (Action_id: 1), which is unsafe due to the close proximity of Vehicle `368`.
- Change to right lane (Action_id: 2), which is unsafe due to the risk of collision.
- Accelerate (Action_id: 3), which is unsafe and could lead to a collision with Vehicle `368` due to decreased TTC.
- Decelerate (Action_id: 4), which is deemed safe and recommended to create more distance from Vehicle `368`.

Thus, the best course of action right now is to decelerate in order to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead and prepare for a potential safe right lane change in the future.

Final action: `#### 4`
