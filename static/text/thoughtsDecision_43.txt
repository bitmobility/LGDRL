Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, we need to ensure that we maintain appropriate speed and distance from the vehicle ahead in the same lane.

1. Verify if the vehicle in front is at a safe distance: Vehicle `992` is `38.21 m` ahead, moving at a speed of `19.13 m/s`. The TTC can be approximately calculated as \( TTC = \frac{`38.21 m`}{`19.13 m/s` - `14.11 m/s`} \approx 7.44 \), which is greater than 4. Therefore, the distance is safe.

2. Evaluate speed adjustment: Since the ego-vehicle is traveling at `14.11 m/s` and Vehicle `992` is moving at `19.13 m/s`, there is room to safely increase speed and close the gap, as the action utility analysis recommends acceleration due to being too far from the front vehicle.

3. Finalize decision: As no lane change is possible and acceleration is safe and recommended, the decision is to accelerate.

Final action: `#### 3`
