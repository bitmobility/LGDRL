Firstly, examine the distance and speed difference with the car ahead in the current lane (Vehicle `368`). The distance is `36.91 m` and its speed is `16.27 m/s` with a deceleration of -`2.00 m/s`². Compute the time-to-collision (TTC) to ensure it's more than 4:

- Relative speed: 22.21 - 16.27 = `5.94 m/s`
- TTC = Distance / Relative speed = 36.91 / 5.94 ≈ 6.21 seconds, which is greater than 4 seconds. Thus, it is acceptable for now.

Secondly, evaluate the possibility of a right lane change. The vehicle ahead in the right lane (Vehicle `552`) has a distance of `38.80 m` with a speed of `21.98 m/s`, nearly matching your speed. However, Vehicle `600` is only `4.10 m` behind in the right lane traveling at `17.50 m/s`, making a right lane change unsafe.

Based on the action utility analysis, a right lane change is unsafe. Therefore, maintaining the current lane is advisable. 

Finally, from the safe options available (Idle, Accelerate, Decelerate), since a right lane change is not viable and considering the TTC is currently sufficient, an Idle action is logical to maintain a safe situation. 

Final action: `#### 1`
