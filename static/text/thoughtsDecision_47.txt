Currently, you are in the rightmost lane, so the objective of moving right is already accomplished. No further right lane change needs to be considered because you are already at the rightmost position.

Next, let's ensure we're maintaining an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car directly in front (Vehicle `992`). The distance to Vehicle `992` is `43.14 m`, and its speed is slightly faster at `19.55 m/s` compared to your `18.74 m/s`.

Remaining at the current speed would likely increase the distance further due to the car ahead's faster speed. We need to keep this in mind to avoid being too far, which would impact efficiency and could lead to unnecessary delays.

Additionally, the action utility analysis suggests that accelerating is safe and recommended. This action increases efficiency by reducing the distance to the car ahead to an appropriate level without impacting safety.

There can be no right lane change as there is no lane to your right, and you are already positioned where you intend to be.

Considering both safety (maintaining safe distance with TTC) and efficiency (reducing unnecessary gaps and delays), accelerating provides the effective balance here.

Final action: `#### 3`
