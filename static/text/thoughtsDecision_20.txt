Considering the current situation:

1. Maintain appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front:
   - Vehicle `600` is `20.94 m` ahead in the same lane, with a speed of `19.31 m/s`. The ego vehicle is traveling at `10.63 m/s`, much slower than vehicle `600`. Because of the speed difference, maintaining a time-to-collision (TTC) greater than 4 seconds is critical. As it is unsafe, taking the first action step requires slowing down to avoid getting too close to the vehicle ahead.

2. Check for possible right lane change:
   - Right lane change is deemed unsafe. Vehicle `264` is `36.93 m` ahead and is moving at `16.80 m/s`. Meanwhile, vehicle `784` is only `10.55 m` behind at `15.15 m/s`. Therefore, a right lane change poses a collision risk given the relative speeds and vehicle proximities.

3. Action utility analysis:
   - Deceleration is marked as safe and recommended because the ego vehicle is too close to vehicle `600`. No mention of any other safe actions besides slowing down.

Based on this analysis, it is safe and advisable to decelerate to ensure appropriate distance from vehicle `600` and maintain safety with the surrounding vehicles.

Final action: `#### 4`
